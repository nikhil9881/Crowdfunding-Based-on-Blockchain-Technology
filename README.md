## 🔎 About  

This project is a blockchain-based crowdfunding DApp (decentralized application). Its goal is to provide a transparent and secure platform for fundraising — leveraging smart contracts to avoid fraud and ensure trust.  

This implementation was created during my final year of engineering and now showcases my interest and skills in blockchain development.
